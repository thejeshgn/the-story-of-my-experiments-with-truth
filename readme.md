# About
This is my version of Gandi's 'The Story of My Experiments with Truth'. In a true geek way, I have forked it and made my own with notes and references.

The git repository of the fork is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/thejeshgn/the-story-of-my-experiments-with-truth "GitHub Repository") and also on [Penflip](https://www.penflip.com/thejeshgn/the-story-of-my-experiments-with-truth "Penflip Repository").

I use Penflip to edit and collaborate andn Github as backup.

Once my initial setup is complete. I will make this book available in all electronic formats for easy download.

Thank you,
